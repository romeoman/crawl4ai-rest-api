We also reserve the right to delete, change, or reclaim your username, URL, or other identifier.\n## Content in Discord\u2019s services\n#### Your Content\nWhen we say \u201cyour content\u201d in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our services. This includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this section of these terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others\u2019 use of your content.\nOur services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages, group direct messages, and in small and large servers. Some of these servers may be larger spaces, and if you share content within them, that content may be more likely to be accessed by a lot of people. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these spaces. You should be aware that these permissions are set by server owners or admins, and they may change over time. Please understand where you are posting on Discord, familiarize yourself with the relevant server permissions when joining and posting in a certain space, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content. \nYour content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord. Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We don\u2019t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license\u2014which is a form of permission\u2014to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and improving our services:\n  * Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate your content in manners consistent with your use of the services. (For example, so we can store and display your content.)\n  * Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if you\u2019ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, so we can display your messages if you post them in certain servers or recommend that content to others.)\n  * Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content. (For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)\n  * Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended. (For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)",

              "content": "This section describes Discord's purpose as a platform for social interaction, the types of services offered, content sharing practices, and details on the data collected from users, including account information, content, and activities, as well as how this data is used and protected.\n---\n## Discord is the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online\nWe created Discord to be the best place to talk, hang out and have fun with friends online. Whether you\u2019re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to connect with friends.\nOur \u201cservices\u201d has the same meaning as defined in the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance\u2014any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too.\nAs explained in our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time.\nWe may also use content posted in larger spaces to help us develop, improve and power our services, including features that help you catch up on conversations and safety features that identify harmful content on the services and support the enforcement of our [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don\u2019t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the \u201cHow to control your privacy\u201d section below. You can learn more about our approach to safety and content moderation, including how we use your information for these purposes, in our [Safety Center](https://discord.com/safety/our-approach-to-content-moderation). You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content.\nWe make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties.\n## The information we collect\nWe collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.\n#### Information you provide to us\n  * **Account information**. When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You\u2019ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, we may require additional information to verify your age. You may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or choose a display name.\n  * **Content you create**. This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, or post other content that you create with features that we develop. You may also upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don\u2019t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings.\n  * **Payment information**. If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If you sell something through Discord, you may be requir",
